              On the strength of these works some call him the "father of botany." These books documented types of plants commonly used at the time, 
              and described attempts to cultivate wild plants. 
              Theophrastus developed his own vocabulary to describe plant processes and horticultural and agricultural efforts.

              Botany is the scientific study of plants—how plants function, what they look like, how they are related to each other, 
              where they grow, how people make use of plants, and how plants evolved.
